   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Introduction
============
do_x3dna uses `3DNA package <http://x3dna.org>`_ to calculate several structural descriptors or parameters of DNA/RNA using the GROMACS MD trajectory. It extracts output of the 3DNA package,and saves these parameters to external output files with function of time. 

**Note:** do_x3dna can be used for analyzing DNA and RNA from the trajectory files that are obtained from other MD packages such as NAMD and AMBER. A PDB file could be used in place of a GROMACS *tpr* file.


Example:
--------

* Bending in the helical axis of a `mitochondiral DNA <http://pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3tmm>`_:

.. image:: ./images/p3tmm.png
   :scale: 60 %
   :align: center

-------

* Bending in the helical axis of a DNA in the `nucleosome <http://pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3Ut9>`_:

.. image:: ./images/p3ut9.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :align: center
