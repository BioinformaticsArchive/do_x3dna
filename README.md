do_x3dna
========

do\_x3dna uses 3DNA package to calculate several structural descriptors or parameters of DNA/RNA using the GROMACS MD trajectory. It extracts output of the [3DNA package](http://x3dna.org),and saves these parameters to external output files as the function of time. 

<strong> Note: </strong> do\_x3dna can be used for analyzing DNA and RNA from the trajectory files that are obtained from other MD packages such as NAMD and AMBER. A PDB file could be used in place of a GROMACS _tpr_ file.

To execute do_x3dna, 3DNA package should be installed and $X3DNA environment variable (Detail is given in 3DNA manual) should be defined.
